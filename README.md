# Open Movie Desktop
Open Movie Desktop is a free and open-source movie management application that allows users to explore and watch movies from local databases.

## TODO
We need a way to copy url to clipboard or play movies in movie details window but we don't have a way to do that yet.
You (as developer) should implement this feature.
